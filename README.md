# RTOS


The goal of this project is write an RTOS solution for an M4F controller that implements a preemptive
RTOS solution with support for semaphores, yielding, sleep, priority scheduling, priority inheritance,
memory protection, and a shell interface.
A simple framework for building the RTOS is included in the rtos.c file.
